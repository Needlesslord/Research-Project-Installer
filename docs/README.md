# Personal Research: Installer

This web page and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Needlesslord/Research-Project-Installer) where it is created from are dedicated to what an Installer is and how to create one for your software in Windows using xml integration and the Wix Toolset extension to work wih, with small steps and a solution provided. For further information, a bibliography is provided below.

## What is an Installer?

An **Installer**, **Installation Package** or **Application Packaging** is used to install software programs on a system. They simplify the process of installing software by providing the user with a step-by-step process with options to select from which will best suit individual needs. The istallation process for software depends on your OS (operation system) and the program you are installing. 

You may have seen them as executable (they can come in different formats, usually depending on the device) files you open to install games, different softwares and others, with detailed instructions that you usually skip with the "Next" button. This executable (sofware which is a file used by a service) is created to install an application onto an specified device contain the files, registry and logic. They involve the preparation of standard, structured sofware installations targeted for automated deployment and should be prepared for both commercial software and home-made apps. 

They usually **contain more than only the .exe** (executable file). For example, they often contain multiple files in different locations, shorcuts, registry, runtime engines, .NET registration, shell integration, ActiveX controls, databases, and more! As said before, they can also come in different formats, such as Setup.MSI (Microsoft Windows Installer); Setup.exe (Legacy executables); .APPX (Windows store, introduced with Windows 8); Install.vbs, Install.ps1 or Install. bat (Batch or script files), Loose/Raw Files or .dll, .xla, .xlam, .ppam, .dotm, etc. (add-ins or plug-ins), and more!


## Why are Installers used?

Installers can be used to install games on end-user machines. They usually offer full support for a customized user interface, as well as patching.

**Application management costs** can be a problem for many corporate networks due to the expense of the mantainance of desktop and notebook systems. Therefore, new application management techniques are being developed to help enterprises administer their existing PC investments more efficiently. One of them is application packaging, which helps business manage growing volumes of software for desktop and server systems.


### What should you know before installing a software?

 + First of all, you have to make sure **your computer meets the *system/software requirements* of the program you are attempting to install**, it being a game, utility, etc. It is a listing of what software programs or hardware devices are required to operate the program properly and can be found on their packaging or can be found on the Internet. If your computer does not meet the *minimum requirements*, it will probably not run or not even install. Also, if your computer **only** meets the *minimum requirements* but not the *suggested requirements*, it will run, but very slowly. 
 If you do not understand a term used in the requirements (they can be very technical and most people may not be familiar with many IT lingo), the easiest way to understand the meaning behind it is to perform a search on the word. [Computer Hope](https://www.computerhope.com/) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a very complete web where all these terms and information can be easily found.
 
 + Secondly, you should **check the manual or readme file**, which contains the **exact instructions** on how to install your program and are usually fouund in the same directory (a directory could be compared to a folder, for those who are not familiar with the term) as the installation files. 
 For those of you who may not be ffamiliar with what a "readme file" is, it is a file with the extensions .txt or .md that contains information for the user about the software, such as instructions, additional help and details about patches and updates. Sometimes, the information it contains may not be included in the full documentation, so it is good to check out both. I the readme is not in a .txt file extension, your computer may not know how to open it. You cna choose the Notepad (advised) or any text editor of choice to open the file, since it will only contain text.
 
 
 + Pro tip! When installing any new program, it is advised to **first close or disable any running programs** and, after installing it, if it promps you to **reboot the computer**, do so.
