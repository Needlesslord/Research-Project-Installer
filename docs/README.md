## What is an [*Installer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_(computer_programs)#Installer)?

An **Installer**, **Installation Package** or **Application Packaging** is used to install software programs on a system. They simplify the process of installing software by providing the user with a step-by-step process with options to select from which will best suit individual needs. The istallation process for software depends on your OS (operation system) and the program you are installing. 

You may have seen them as executable (they can come in different formats, usually depending on the device) files you open to install games, different softwares and others, with detailed instructions that you usually skip with the "Next" button. This executable (sofware which is a file used by a service) is created to install an application onto an specified device contain the files, registry and logic. They involve the preparation of standard, structured sofware installations targeted for automated deployment and should be prepared for both commercial software and home-made apps. 

They usually **contain more than only the .exe** (executable file). For example, they often contain multiple files in different locations, shorcuts, registry, runtime engines, .NET registration, shell integration, ActiveX controls, databases, and more! As said before, they can also come in different formats, such as Setup.MSI (Microsoft Windows Installer); Setup.exe (Legacy executables); .APPX (Windows store, introduced with Windows 8); Install.vbs, Install.ps1 or Install. bat (Batch or script files), Loose/Raw Files or .dll, .xla, .xlam, .ppam, .dotm, etc. (add-ins or plug-ins), and more!


### What are Installers used for?

Installers can be used to install games on end-user machines. They usually offer full support for a customized user interface, as well as patching.

**Application management costs** can be a problem for many corporate networks due to the expense of the mantainance of desktop and notebook systems. Therefore, new application management techniques are being developed to help enterprises administer their existing PC investments more efficiently. One of them is application packaging, which helps business manage growing volumes of software for desktop and server systems.


### What should you know before installing a software?

 + First of all, you have to make sure **your computer meets the *system/software requirements* of the program you are attempting to install**, it being a game, utility, etc. It is a listing of what software programs or hardware devices are required to operate the program properly and can be found on their packaging or can be found on the Internet. If your computer does not meet the *minimum requirements*, it will probably not run or not even install. Also, if your computer **only** meets the *minimum requirements* but not the *suggested requirements*, it will run, but very slowly. 
*__Pro tip!__* If you do not understand a term used in the requirements (they can be very technical and most people may not be familiar with many IT lingo), the easiest way to understand the meaning behind it is to perform a search on the word. [Computer Hope](https://www.computerhope.com/) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a very complete web where all these terms and information can be easily found.
 
 + Secondly, you should **check the manual or readme file**, which contains the **exact instructions** on how to install your program and are usually fouund in the same directory (a directory could be compared to a folder, for those who are not familiar with the term) as the installation files. 
 For those of you who may not be ffamiliar with what a "readme file" is, it is a file with the extensions .txt or .md that contains information for the user about the software, such as instructions, additional help and details about patches and updates. Sometimes, the information it contains may not be included in the full documentation, so it is good to check out both. I the readme is not in a .txt file extension, your computer may not know how to open it. You cna choose the Notepad (advised) or any text editor of choice to open the file, since it will only contain text.
 
 
 + *__Pro tip!__* Finally, when installing any new program, it is advised to **first close or disable any running programs** and, after installing it, if it promps you to **reboot the computer**, do so.


### What is the real purpose of Installers?


After all of this, application packages may be a very generic concept to you or you don't fully know why you should use it. Of course, Installers were first created to solve arising problems, and in this section I will talk about the concrete ppurposes and benefits sought.

- First of all, only the simplest applications can work with a simple file copy, and even then you need to have a **convenient** way to actually download and do the copying of the files to the right location.

- The setup is also a **marketing tool**: it can be used for branding and consistency across products. Also, it allows the installation of trial versios of the product.

- A setup provides **upgrade and patching features** for newer versions, as well as **uninstall and cleanup** for the sowftware when the user wants the remove it from the computer.

- **Digital certificates** can be used to sign, to ensure that the file cannot be hampered with in transit or that the vendor is certificable and hence, serious.

- Finally, it can **prevent piracy**, with a solid setup and deployment.


### What is [*Deployment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_deployment)?

First of all, we need to understad what [*Automated Builds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) are. In a short and easy way, it is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes. This means that, with no human interaction, the code will create releases of our software, like different "launches", mainly to have a contingency plan. Imagine you are working on your code, but you made a mistake and it doesn't work anymore; you could go back to a previous version, created automatically, in order to continue working. There are many programs which can do that for you. 

Automated build can be divided in two main parts: *deployment* and [*continuous iteration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration). However, we are just going to talk about deployment in this research.

Diving into *deployment*, it is a very simple concept: it is all of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. Somethign to take into account is that, since it involves both the producer and the consumer, it has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics. 

In short, software deployment includes all the process required for preparing a software application to run and operate in a specific environment. It can bring many advantages, such as it being time saving, enhancing security, enabling to monitoring of user actions, effectiveness in software updates, and more. For more about its advantages, check out the following [link](https://pdf.wondershare.com/business/what-is-software-deployment.html).


#### What should you know about Deployment?

The following part is particular to MSI Tools, which will be introduced below.

The tasks and features included in a setup are very different and they can range from very basic, such as third party tool support, to highly customized tasks. MSI has "custom actions", where you can actually code yourself to deal with unique deployment requirements. In this section, however, I'm only going to be talking about the first one, since custom actions ca be used to improve and go beyond in your Installer.

The set up basics are fundamental to your Installation Package. All third party tools provide good support for there setup fundamentals, but there are some differences. The installation of prerequisites may be the area where third party tools and free frameworks differe the most in terms of ease of use. However, there are some fundamentals that all setups must have built-in.

- They must check if the system is suitable for installation (your computer meets the *system/software requirements*)

- They must scan for presence and, if necessary, install prerequisites and runtimes

- They must provide a competent GUI, which must be suitable for the input of required settings from the user

- They must allow installation in silent mode (for corporate use, mostly)


### Why is Deployment important for the Installer?

As said before, deployment is a simple concept, but it has some things we must take into account, since it can cause errors in the long run. Therefore, I will introduce the most common and important problems that can be generated by the deployment of software applications.

- **Errors are cumulative.** Errors in deployment are cumulative, since once you have deployed an error, you generally have no access to the machine in question to debug, which could do more damage in the long run. A delivery process is being managed, not just debugging and binaries.

- **A disciplined approach is needed.** Deplyoment (setups) is tha complex proces of migrating any computer from one stable state to another; in other words, change the files directory from one computer to another. This requires a disciplined approach. The setup should install all the required files and settings and ensure the product, the software we are creating the installer for, is configured for a fisrts launch to ready to be configured upon launch. This means we need to have a software which won't crash.

- **Setup requirements are always changing and growing.** In addition to technical problems that we may have, we have the list of things a setup may need to do, which with upgrades, changes and advancements in technology, has to also be updated and is continuously growing. New versions of Windows (in this particular case, which could be generalized) seem to bring new obstacles to make deployment harer.

Then, even if it can create problems for our source code and the list of requirements is always growing, is it worth? The answer, of course, is yes. It is actually key for Installation Packages, since it can allow for example, unattended setup, meaning that, taking into account that some installs are toughter than others, it can help you distribute such packags to your computer by recording the changes in your system after it is installed and then these changes are deployed to other computers on your network automatically, so you don't have to do it. To summarize, it only make the life of developers easier, since it simplifies your work, automates the code and the releases and it can prevent errors in the code.


*__For more information about Deployment, please take a look at the research my collegue [Daniel Ruiz](https://github.com/xsiro) did on [Automated Builds](https://github.com/xsiro/RESEARCH) or [Pol Galan](https://github.com/pgalmor) did as well on the same topic [Automated Builds CI/CD](https://github.com/pgalmor/Automated-Builds-CI-CD).__*

## Have you seen it in games?

Installation Packages are used broadly, as said before. From programs to games to other type of software. However, in this section, I will show you where you may have seen it in games and how they made your life easier. Mostly, since users are familiar with this way of installing games and also make it really simple, fast and easy all (or almost all) games use Installers.

*Disclaimer! Please note that these pictures are from different years, so the design or usage may be different now.*


### Game Shops

For example, in Game shops, when you want to use the app instead of the web, you are asked to install them to your computer through an Installation Package. Epic Games and Steam are used as examples below.

Here you can see two different pictures of the Epic Games Launcher Setup, which in this case, since it was in a Windows OS uses MSI. In both of them they are asking for a "Destination Folder" or "directory". This means they installer is asking for a folder where you want to save all the files needed to run the game and possible future downloads.

![Epic-Games-Installer-Directory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014839-e39c5e80-8e5d-11ea-8675-8af2289bce46.png)

![Epic-Games-Installer-Directory-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014840-e434f500-8e5d-11ea-9e7b-747972856413.png)

Here you can see how the Epic Games Launcher Setup is installing all the needed files in your computer.

![Epic-Games-Installer-Launcher](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014841-e4cd8b80-8e5d-11ea-9e3d-d6fea7ca88ea.jpg)

Here you can see how to uninstall a game directly from the Epic Games Store, step by step.

![Epic-Games-Uninstall-Game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014843-e4cd8b80-8e5d-11ea-9b8f-5d0848f181a8.png)

The following picture is from Steam's Installer. It shows the License agreement, which you have to accept in order to press "Next".

![Steam-License-Agreement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014851-e72fe580-8e5d-11ea-908a-d984f41d7ef6.jpg)

The following two pictures are from installing a game from Steam on a Mac OS (Apple). The first one shows how the end-user can choose whether to create or not shourtcuts and the second one is the message Steam displays once you have already installed your product.

![Steam-Game-Install-Shortcuts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014849-e72fe580-8e5d-11ea-89a4-de2d4b6288e6.png)

![Steam-Game-Install-Finish](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014847-e6974f00-8e5d-11ea-884e-d0b41d4d4684.png)


### Games

In games, for example, you always see them. The following images display different installers for individual games, which are not installed from Game Shops.

Here we can see what is first shown to the user when installing LOL (League of Legends).

![Install-League-of-Legends](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014844-e5662200-8e5d-11ea-8058-f40517477f2f.jpg)


### Mods

Of course, Mods for different games also require and almost always use installers. The following picture is for an installation of a Vehicle Mod Pack for the game GTA IV (Grand Theft Auto IV).

![Install-Mods-GTAIV](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81014845-e6974f00-8e5d-11ea-9876-c1d2a04dfdbf.jpg)

## What is the approach to this problem in this research?

This research in particular will be used in an RTS game developed for the same subject, Project 2 taught at CITM-TTC (UPC). The OS (operating system) used to develop it is Windows (in particular, Windows 10 and 8), therefore, we are going to use *MSI* (Microsoft Windows Installer).


### What is [*MSI* (Microsoft Windows Installer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer)?

MSI, also known as Microsoft Software Installer or nowaadays as Windows Installer, is an installer package file format used by Windows. MSI files are used for installation, storage and removal of programs. It was developed by Microsoft and it is used for the O of Microsoft Windows, under the [Freeware License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware).

MSI files are database files, used by Windows Installer. They contain information about an application which is devided into features and components, and every component may hold files, registry data, shortcuts, etc. It also contains the UI that is to be used for installing, and various other data such as any prerequisites to look for, custom actions to execute, the order of the installation procedure, whether to support Administrative installations, etc. It can also contain the actual files to be installed themselves, but this isn't always the case. MSI files are executed by an EXE file that is part of Windows, called MSIEXEC.EXE. This application reads the data in the MSI file and executes the installation.

MSI files are the current recommended way of doing installations on Windows. The alternative is writing a program that performs the installation itself. 


#### Why am I using MSI?

In my particular case, I had to choose with limited options in mind. My small scope of project which is only for a research for my university's degree with no revenue from it made me move towards free software. In addition my computer and my university's computers run on Windows OS and I had to choose a reliable software to work on it. MSI fulfills all the requisits.

Windows Installer has many built-in functions that will save you time and effort.

##### How can you test an Application in a [*Virtual Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)?


###### What is a [*Virtual Machine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)?

Before explaining how to test an application in a Virtual Machine, it is important to undertand the concept and what it is. Basically, a Virtual Machine (VS) is an emulation of a computer system. They are based on computer architectures and provide the same functionality of a physical computer. 

There are different kinds fo virtual machines, each one with different functions:

- [**System virtual machines (VMs).**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_virtual_machine) They provide a substitute for the real machine, since they provide the functionalities needed to execute an entire OS, allowing as well multiple environments which are isolated from one another but co-exist in the same physical machine

- [**Process virtual machines.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines) They are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.

**The main purpose of VM is to test software in the safest way.** Testing in VM allws to simulate a full operating system, isolated from the rest of our machine, and it's the perfect way to test our setup installer to check whether it works or not in different OS and their previous versions.

###### What is [*VirtualBox*](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox)?

There are several tools that you can use to create VM. In my researh, however, I'm going to use VirtualBox, but bear in mind that there are many other and some may be more suitable for you project, depending on the scope, knowledge, etc.

Oracle VM VirtualBox is a free and open-source compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris and OpenSolaris. Basically it supports the creation and management of guest virtual machines. It is aimed both for enterprises and home use. Bear in mind that VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and a growing list of features.

*In the following [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/) you can go to the official web page of VirtualBox.*
*In the following [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL) you can see the license (GNU General Public License (GPL)).*
*In the following [link](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Documentation) you can see the documentation.*


###### How do you work with VirtualBox?

###### *How do you install VirtualBox?*

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **TO DO** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 
 Before installing VirtualBox, please be sure that you install the proper platform package according to your current OS.
 

###### *How do you create your own VM in VirtualBox and start using it?*

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **TO DO** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 

Obviously, once we have installed VirtualBox we cannot start testing right away. First, it is necessary to create a secluded place where your sofware will be alone to test it.

- First, open Vitual Box and click "New" to create a new virtual machine



For a more visual representation, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=65&v=sB_5fqiysi4&feature=emb_logo) you can find a video by TechGumbo on *How to Use VirtualBox (Begginers Guide)*.

### What is [*NSIS*](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page)?


**NSIS** stands for *Nullsoft Scriptable Install System*. It is a professional open source system to create Windows installers. It is small and flexible, which makes it very suitable for internet distribution. It also has many plug-ins and scripts available to create web installers, communicate with Windows and other software components, install or update components, and more. [Here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Features) you can see the list with its features, from where I will highlight, in addition with what has already been said, its custom dialogs and interfaces, multiple languages available, support for web installation and file patching, project integration and different releases and automatic bulds, its portable compiler, its easy and understandable design, and more. [Here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/License) you can read the license.

#### What are the features of NSIS?

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **TO DO** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -




#### How do you install NSIS?

The following images will show you all the steps to install NSIS. In addition, I will show you how to install a package to help you with the creation of scripts for NSIS.

##### Installing NSIS (and Uninstalling)

First of all, you have to go to the download page, you have the link [here](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download). In this case, we are downloading the version NSIS 3.05, released Decembre 15th 2019. [Here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%203/3.05/RELEASE.html/view) you have the release notes. You just have to **click "Download"** in bold letters under the release date and version.

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496479-33dd4b80-92b8-11ea-92cc-c9a8f2604bcc.PNG)

Once downloaded it, you just have to click the downloaded file, called "nsis-3.05-setup.exe". You will find this file in the "Downloads" directory unless you have specifically changed the directory path or saved it else where. Double click on it and the NSIS installer will start running. You will see this. **Press "Next".**

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496614-165cb180-92b9-11ea-821d-6bc2bde1c956.PNG)

Next you will be shown the License Agreement. **Press "I agree".** It is advisable to read it throroughly.

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496612-15c41b00-92b9-11ea-9ed9-2085c326b147.PNG)

Now you will need to choose what components to install. Since one of NSIS' main features is how light it is, you can install them all without worrying about taking up too much space. Therefore, it is advisable to leave the predefined option "Full" in the "Select the type of install". It will only require 7MB. **Press "Next".**

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496947-9c79f780-92bb-11ea-8699-60ac375200f0.PNG)

Then, you will have to choose the Install location. It is also advisable to leave the destination folder as it is, but you can change it if you wnat to. **Press "Install".**

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496948-9d128e00-92bb-11ea-9231-4a5eaa3f5e54.PNG)

It will show the following, with a bar loading to show how the install is going. It will take no time due to its size. **Press "Next"** once the install has finished.

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496949-9d128e00-92bb-11ea-8402-635ea2640190.PNG)

Your software is ready to use! Now you can choose whether you want directly to run NSIS and/or show the release notes. It is advisable to only "Run NSIS" and to untick the other box, this way you can test if NSIS is working well. **Press "Finish".**

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496950-9dab2480-92bb-11ea-82b5-8b7d3e628849.PNG)

Once you run it this will be shown to you. 

![8a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496951-9dab2480-92bb-11ea-80ac-1c7bffb5d55a.PNG)

In addition, this is what it will show you if you had chosen to see the release notes. However, you can find them in the web page too.

![8b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496952-9e43bb00-92bb-11ea-8726-7d29a263a7ba.PNG)

To uninstall NSIS, you must double click again the executable called "nsis-3.05-setup.exe". The first you will be shown will be the same as when installing, however, at some point you will be asked "Unistall NSIS" or "Add/Reinstall components". Choose "Uninstall NSIS". After that you need to choose the locaion where all the files related NSIS are and then click "Uninstall". A pregress bar will be shown and after choosing to "Close", NSIS will no longer be in your computer. The following images will show you the process.

![A](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81496953-9e43bb00-92bb-11ea-953d-0f06f293deb5.PNG)

##### Installing/Using NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator 

In order to do the TODOS and learn  how to create scripts to create installers, we will help ourselves with NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator.

First of all, you have to download the .zip from the following [web page](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/NSIS_Quick_Setup_Script_Generator). There is a link provided to download the package. It can be found in "Links"->"Download", in the line that says "NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator  Nsisqssg.zip (74 KB) the current release.".

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51851736/81497300-dba94800-92bd-11ea-8680-17bb71750aac.PNG)

Once downloaded it, you just have to click the downloaded file, called "Nsisqssg.zip". You will find this file in the "Downloads" directory unless you have specifically changed the directory path or saved it else where. We want to unzip the file, so you will have to right-click the file and select "Extract in Nsisqssg\". This will creeate a folder where all the scrips will be saved, both in .nsi format, .ini and .txt. If you go inside this folder, you will find an executable called "NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator.exe". Double click it to start running. **Press "Next".**

After that, the app will start showing you commands, but I will talk about them later, since from this point onwards you are already creating a script. The steps to create said script will be found belown in the exercise.

## Can it be improved?

There is a lot of room to improve your installers using NSIS. Since you can create your own scripts and produce all the content you need for your own Installer. In addition, some basic scripts can be used, and always come with NSIS when installing.

## How can YOU do it?


### What should you know before starting?

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **TO DO** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


 + Project files and components
 
 + Directory System
 
 + Shortcut Components
 
 + Icon
 
 + UI Dialog


### What are the TODOs (exercises) teach  you to do?

lists of todos and expected outcome and what they are needed for


-------



To start with your Installer, as obvious as it may be, you have to install the software first. Above this section you can find how to install NSIS, the program I will be teaching you how to use in order to create an Installer for your game, software adn others.

 - In the first step, to get familiar with NSIS, I will be teaching how to create an executable (.exe) from a .zip. Since this research is aimed mostly to the games developed in the subject Project II taught at CITM and they are delivered in .zip and also are released in Github in the same format, I thought it was a previous step that would be nice to get to know the software and how it works.

 - Now that you already know how to create a very basic Installer, without Icon or any personalization, I will introduce you to .nsi scripts to do so. First of all, they can be created and work from any text editor, so you don't need to install any other softwares. However, bear in mind there are some programs which can help you with scripts. Note though that these scripts have a language you will have to learn. [Here you have a summary]().





### What do you have *TODO*?

*__Pro tip!__* If you are using Visual Studio, you can press Ctr+Shift+F and look for "TODO" in all your code. This way you will find the exercises in the code easier

*__Disclaimer! You can find the solutions below.__*


#### TODO0-1: Create an installer from a .zip file

After opening NSI, you are shown different "links" that will take you to different parts of NSIS depending on what you need to do for your Installer. You will have to choose the option from the "Compiler" you belive will lead you to create an executable from a .zip file. Once there, you will need to choose from which .zip you want to take the files of your software, the name of the installer and the default folder. Then, choose "BZip2" and generate your file. You have it!

#### TODO0-2: Learn the NSI language

[Here]() you can find a link to a script with basic syntax errors in this language. Find them all so that it works.

#### TODO1: Using NSIS Quick Setup Script Generator to create a basic script

As said before, we will use this software provided by NSIS to create a basic script. Open the executable and play with it. The interface is very intuitive. After completing all of the fields, you will have your first script in NSIS. Of course, you may not understand some part or if you can leave a field blank, etc, so an explanation on how to use this software can be found in the solutions below.

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - **TO DO** - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


#### TODO1: Customize product features and mapping .exe project files

#### TODO2: Add Start Menu Shortcut

#### TODO3: Add Desktop shortcut

#### TODO4: Add control panel and .exe project icons

#### TODO5: Add UI Dialog theme (installDir)

#### TODO6: Customize UI Dialog theme using .bmp files

#### TODO7: Add Windows License 

#### TODO8: Uncomment dependencies (libraries, dll, assets, etc)








### How is it done?



#### TODO0-1



If you need more help, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDFITKDbs-M) you have a Youtube video Tutorial by Ivan Angelkoski that may help.

#### TODO0-2

[Here]() you can find the script without errors and small explanations. Remember that ";" is used to comment, so the explanations will be after them.

#### TODO1

Here there is an explanation on how to use Quick Setup Script Generator.

AS stated beforehand, to use this software you just need the executable. Once done, all your scripts will be saved into the same folder, but I'll get to that later. Open the executable and **Press "Next"**.

!

Here is where you will start creating your script with the help of your software. In this section you are asked for a "New project name". You can also "Load a previously saved project", but since we are creating a script from scratch we will not use that feature. Here you can write down the name of your game. The following two images are used as a how it is first shown and what I have written for the example used in this research. **Press "Next".**

## How can you continue improving?

To continue learning about installers, I propose that you do those exercises on these other installers, which are [WiX Toolset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) and [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php).

- **Inno Setup** is a free installer for Windows programs. [Here](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php#features) you can see its features, from where I will highlight the support they offer, the creation of a single EXE and customizable setup types, as well as uninstall capabilities, shortcuts, multilingual, supports encrypted and passwarded installs as well as digital signs, and its full source code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc). [Here](https://jrsoftware.org/ishelp/) you will find its documentation. [Here](https://jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt) you can read the license.


 - **WiX Toolset**, is short for *Windows Installer XML Toolset*, is a free software toolset that builds Windows Installer packages from [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML). For those which are not familiar with XML, it is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) (a system for annotating a document in a way that is **syntactically distinguishable** from the text, which means that, when the document is processed to display it, the markup language, what you have written, it is not shown, since it is only used to give format to the text) widely used, remarkably because it is used across the Internet. It uses C++ and C# and the target OS is always Windows, as the name itself indicates. *In the following [link](https://wixtoolset.org/) you can go to the official web page of WiX Toolset.* The following [link](https://wixtoolset.org/) leads to the official web page of WiX Toolset. MSBuild is supported from the command line, Visual Studio, and Team Build and includes several extensions that offer functionality beyond that of Windows Installer. You can also create setup bundles that install prerequisites like the .NET Framework and other runtimes along with your own product. In addition, you have custom actions, where you can code if you want to go further in your Installer. In the following [link](https://wixtoolset.org/development/wips/) you can go to the official web page of WiX Toolset, to the WiX Improvement Proposals. If you want to master WiX Toolset, the following links will lead you to other tutorials which may be useful:

   + [Here](https://www.firegiant.com/wix/tutorial/) you have a link with another tutorial with another approach on how to use the WiX Toolset.
   + [Here]() you will find another research on installers using the WiX Toolset.
   
   
   
 - [Here](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/user-guide/tutorial-simple.html) you have another very simple tutorial aimed at those with **NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE** in using [*Advanced Installer*](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/), using the [Freeware edition](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/top-freeware-features.html). However, this tool, which is very powerful and easy to use, it is only available on trial for 30 days, after which you have to [pay](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/purchase.html).
